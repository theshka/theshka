My other interests include: hanging with my kitty, good friends, good food, current affairs, cycling, music, and summertime. I have volunteered with Pride Toronto, Canadian Cancer Society, Walk for MS, and numerous other related events.

> FUN FACT: My cat's full-name is Princess Meowington Meow Meow III â€¦ but I call her "Princess" for short. She was a stray kitten who would come sit at my basement suite window in the winter. Now weâ€™re best buds. ðŸ˜»
